description:
    This package provides a simple interface to Concorde, a solver for the
    Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP).  Concorde is available from
    <http://www.tsp.gatech.edu/concorde/index.html>.
    .
    This library uses the Linâ€“Kernighan heuristic via Concorde's @linkern@
    program.  It quickly produces good tours, which may not be optimal.  You
    can directly control the tradeoff between run time and solution quality.
    .
    An example program is included.
    .
    Currently, only problems in two-dimensional Euclidean space are supported.
    .
    More features of Concorde can be added on request.  Feature requests and
    patches are always welcome.
